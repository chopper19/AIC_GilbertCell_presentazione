\frametitle{Conclusions}
Good news:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The circuit correctly mixes;
	\item Reasonable conversion gain (A\textsubscript{v,layout} $\simeq$ 2.9, A\textsubscript{v,schem} $\simeq$ 2.7) with good matching between simulations and hand calculations;
	\item Acceptable amount of distortion if the input power remains well below the 1dB compression point ($\simeq$100mV);
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Conclusions}
Bad news:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The AMI's 0.6 by MOSIS is old-fashioned, not meant for RF applications;
	\item The extractor used to generate the layout (Cadence Diva) was not able to provide the full set of parasitic elements, leading to inaccurate analysis;
	\item Wide circuit area necessary to fulfil the specifications (gain, power consumption), this produces a large amount of parasitic elements.  
\end{itemize}
To sum up, the circuit functions properly, although it probably \textbf{overestimates} what would be the real behaviour.
